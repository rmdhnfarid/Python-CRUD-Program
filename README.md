RUD, which stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, is a fundamental set of operations in computer programming and database management. It refers to the basic functions that can be performed on a database or data storage system:

Create: This operation allows you to add new data or records to a database. It involves inserting new information into the system, typically with the help of an "insert" command or function.

Read: The Read operation enables you to retrieve and view data from a database. It involves querying the database to access existing information. In CRUD, this is often achieved through "select" queries.

Update: Updating allows you to modify or change existing data in the database. You can use an "update" command or function to make alterations to specific records or fields within records.

Delete: The Delete operation involves removing data or records from the database. It's used to eliminate information that is no longer needed or relevant. The "delete" command or function is employed for this purpose.

These CRUD operations are essential in various software applications, web development, and database management systems, as they provide the core functionality for managing data effectively. Developers use these operations to interact with and manipulate data in their applications, ensuring that information is created, retrieved, updated, and deleted as required for the application's functionality
